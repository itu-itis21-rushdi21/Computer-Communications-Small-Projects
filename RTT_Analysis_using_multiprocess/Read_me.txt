** I used a python script (generate_data_multiprocess) that generated 100 command prompts all will send the traceroute command and store the result in a file.

** I run the script 3 times a day for 4 days. This resulted in 3 files everyday stored in Raw_data.

** The latter 12 files were filtered by time, date, and destination manually. Stored as _data files.

** The data files were filtered to stats_final_files, using there gernerate_data_list python codes.

** Lastly the stats data was copied manually from the files and pasted to python list varaibles in order to plot them using plot_by codes
